# Purpose

The goal of this repository is to work through a workflow that I am probably going to use in the future. All the while creating useful artifacts to myself and potentially others. The goal is to use basics of project management for an individual, combine it with systems engineering description of systems using SysMLV2 with KerML, and then have a final deliverable of a electronic schematic of an SSD.

## Project Breakdown

### KiCad

This is where the electronic schematic will be placed when produced,and ideally with a bill of materials.

### Project

This is the project breakdown with milestone_breakdown.yaml and the project charter with project_charter.md. The goal of this folder is to have a central place for organizing within the project.

### SysML

This is where the SysMLV2 artifacts go. Currently there is only the main model for the SSD, might become a USB flash drive though, named model.sysml .
