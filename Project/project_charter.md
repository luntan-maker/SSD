# Project Charter

## Business Case

The project serves myself, and to a larger extent my family, by providing an opportunity to develop and refine skills that could be tapped into at a later time. While creating artifacts that can be utilized as a reference and source for future projects. I expect that there are three domains that will be refined and connected together to form together a workflow; project management, system modeling though SysMLV2, and electronic schematic capture through KiCad.

## Stakeholders

Myself, and Laura.

## Resources

People: Myself(Lucas)

Software: Visual Studio Code, KiCad

## Scope

This project will cover the design and specification of an SSD at two levels while incorporating elements of project management. The first being at a systems level using SysMLV2. The second is the realization of the design in KiCad.

## Deliverables

Project folder: A folder containing all project organizing related materials

SysML folder: A folder containing a specification file for an SSD using KerML in SysMLV2.

KiCad folder: A folder containing the electronic schematics of the SSD.

## Objectives

Achieve the deliverables, develop an intuition for this new workflow that I am working on, and try to emphasize functional completeness whenever possible.

## Timeline

Today is August 18th of 2025, I expect the project to be completed by the 23rd of August 2025. The first leg I expect to be done in about 3 days, which is the SysML specification. The second leg is the KiCad deliverables, and I expect it to take 2 days to complete.
