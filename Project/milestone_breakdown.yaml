Milestones:
    - Title: SysMLV2 Deliverable
      Deliverable:
        Tangible: 
          - SysMLV2 document specifying SSD operations and structure
        Intangible:
          - Learn how to use KerML and SysMLV2
          - Understand the processes and structure of an SSD

      Goals:
      - Title: Overarching identify and document
        Specific: Identify and document overarching SSD process that can be elaborated later on with structure and further processes
        Measurable: Goal will be achieved when we have an outline of the SSD process documented in model.sysml .
        Actionable: Skill is the only thing lacking, and additional time is cushioning for the skill to develop.
        Relevant: By documenting the overarching process we frame our future SysML efforts within SysML.
        Timely: It is aimed to be done within the first day 06/18/25
        Sub-goals: []
      - Title: Drill down into process
        Specific: Take the read and write use cases and expand upon them such that I can find hardware to construct the processes.
        Measurable: Goal will be achieved once process has been refined sufficiently enough for off the shelf parts to be allocated in a roughly one-to-one correspondence with function
        Actionable: Skill is again lackinging, but through time and perseverence, it is possible.
        Relevant: By taking the overarching needs in sysml and drilling down into the process can we start to make headway on hardware description of an SSD.
        Timely: It is aimed to be done within the first day 06/18/25
